\subsection{Fancy comment macros}

We can add some simple comment \daniele{such as this comment}.

We can also suggest adding text \dasugg{such as this suggestion}, as also
suggest deleting some text \dadel{which is not necessary}.
We can be even more helpful by suggesting a change, for example to fix
\dasubs{tpyos}{typos}.
